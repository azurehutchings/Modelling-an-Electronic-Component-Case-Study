\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of the Report}
The following report investigates the steady-state heat distribution in a newly designed component. 

The report will discuss the mathematical model of the heat distribution in the component and the numerical methods used to solve it in MATLAB. 

\subsection{The Maths of the Problem}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/Component.png}
	\caption{Schematic of electronic component.}
	\label{fig:componentSchematic}
\end{figure}

The component schematic is shown in Figure \ref{fig:componentSchematic}. The location of the component within the device means it's subject to different temperature condition along it's boundaries. The boundary A-B is in perfect thermal contact with another component which the temperature is known to 70\degree C. The boundary C-D is also in perfect thermal contact with another component which the temperature is known to be 40\degree C. The boundary A-E-D is thermally insulated and the boundary B-C is exposed to the air at ambient temperature.
\\\\
This type of model can be described with Laplace's equation. Letting $T(x,y)$ represent the temperature of the component at point $(x, y)$, the model is as follows	

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c}
$\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2}=0$ & in the interior\\
$T = 70$ & on boundary A-B \\
$T = 40$ & on boundary C-D \\
$\boldsymbol{\nabla} T \cdot {\hat{\textbf{n}}} = 0$ & on boundary A-E-D\\
$k\boldsymbol{\nabla}T\cdot\hat{\textbf{n}} = h(T_{\infty} - T)$ & on boundary B-C
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Where the thermal conductivity is $k=3Wm^{-1}C^{-1}$, and the heat transfer coefficient is $h=20 Wm^{-2}C^{-1}$. To begin with, we will assume the ambient termperature is $T_\infty = 20$.
\section{Discretising the Problem}
To numerically solve this problem, we must construct a finite difference mesh and create a matrix to represent this information.\\\\
By splitting the component up into intervals of 0.01, we can split the component into a 7x7 grid. Given the previous mesh
\subsection*{Finite Difference Mesh}
There are 3 different types of mesh that need to be created. These are for the A-E-D boundary, the inside of the mesh, and on the B-C boundary.\\\\On the interior of the mesh, each node contains 4 other nodes adjacent to it, and the change in temperature at that node is given by the equation
\begin{center}
$\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2}=0$
\\
$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}) = 0$
\\
\end{center}
$\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$
