\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of the Report}
The following report investigates the steady-state heat distribution in a newly designed component. 

The report will discuss the mathematical model of the heat distribution in the component and the numerical methods used to solve it in MATLAB. 

\subsection{Issues to be discussed and their significance}

\end{figure}

The component schematic is shown in Figure \ref{fig:componentSchematic}. The location of the component within the device means it's subject to different temperature condition along it's boundaries. The boundary A-B is in perfect thermal contact with another component which the temperature is known to 70\degree C. The boundary C-D is also in perfect thermal contact with another component which the temperature is known to be 40\degree C. The boundary A-E-D is thermally insulated and the boundary B-C is exposed to the air at ambient temperature.
